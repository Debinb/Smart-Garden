# Smart-Garden
An Embedded Systems project to transform your garden by enabling soil moisture monitoring, and light and water control.

## Current Research
TM123GH6PM would have trouble in supporting LLM so I will have to switch to rPi for running the model and sending the information to a database via Nginx or Apache

## Future Plans
Implement deep learning to identify plant diseases and create a database to store the plant health.
